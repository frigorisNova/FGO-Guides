# **Gogh Big or Gogh Home**

Van Gogh is a limited 5* Foreigner who debuted in Imaginary Scramble, an event that's functionally LB 4.5  This isn't about her story or character or whatever. If you rolled for her you probably already like her. This document is going to discuss using her for gameplay.

Her kit focuses on giving herself curse debuffs (1+2) to cleanse (3) for buffs and fuel her NP skill (1) to unleash her buffing NP so you can crit for days. Although she will not clear boss fights as quickly as say NP5 Spishtar Double Castoria, she is a lot of fun to use, surprisingly flexible in compositions and I've used her for just about every CQuest since release. 

This guide will first discuss how to use her skils and then how to pick craft essences and command codes. Afterwards, things such as party compositions and mystic codes wil be discussed. Finally I will discuss my own experiences going through the different Challenge Quests released over the past year along with LB6. 


## Passives and Deck

Traits: Children Servants, Divine, **Existence Outside the Domain**, Female, Humanoid, Servant, Threat to Humanity, Weak To Enuma Elish 

Internals:

NP Gen:.76%

Quick: 4

Arts: 3

Buster: 4

Deck: QQQAB

By the nature of her 3rd skill, you'll want to press her quick cards the most. Her NP being arts means you'll get good NP generation and if you're focusing her face cards then you can easily spam her NP to maintain 100% uptime.

## Skills and NP

Name | Effect | Comments
-----|---------|----------
Void Space Fine Arts+|  Grants self Guts (1000-3000HP) status for 1 time, 5 turns and grants her 3 Curse stacks of 100 damage each at 500% then charge NP based on number of curse stacks (5-10%) CD:8/7/6 |If you have this properly levelled (aka max) it's effectively a 60% battery used after her 2 and 3.. The guts only has a downtime of 1 turn too at max level which is very nice.
Het Gele Huis: The Yellow House A+| CD:7/6/5|The party regen helps with mitigating the damage loss from curse but you'll likely absorb them with her 3 so functionally this is more 3 additional stacks of curse to Gogh.
Soul of Water Channels EX| A targeted attack and starweight buff to an ally, Grants self curse removal on Quick Card and for each successful curse removed, attack up (10%, 3 Turns) to self. Absorbs all curses from party and enemy to self. CD7:/6/5 | The reason you want to be pressing her quick cards and also absorbs the curse stacks from the party (along with any additional ones from your enemies) with her 2. If you have another focus dps (Summer BB) you can choose to buff that dps instead as well.
De Sterrenach|500% Chance to inflict Terror status to all enemies for 1 time, 3 turns. (60% Chance to activate the debuff below every turn. When activated, 500% Chance to Stun them for 1 turn.) Increases party's critical damage for 3 turns. Further increases critical damage of Existence Outside the Domain allies by 100% for 3 turns.Gain 10 critical stars every turn for 3 turns. |The button you want to press as often as possible.  Now you too can pretend to be a CQuest boss and crit for big numbers! The terror procs gives you a soft mitigation by ensuring your opponent can't act, meaning they also can't cast any buffs or debuffs themselves. The offensive part of the NP grants herself and any other existence outside the domain character 150% crit damage and 30% attack up allowing her to hit big numbers on her face cards. For the rest of the party they "only" get 30% attack up and 50% crit.It's trivially easy to keep 100% uptime on these buffs as long as you're pressing some of Gogh's face cards. It also generates its own stars and with Gogh's passive is essentially 12 stars a turn.




## Craft Essences

Effects will be MLB for event CEs and 0LB for gacha CEs.

Name (How to Acquire) | Effect | Comments
-------------|--------------|---------
Traces of Christmas (Christmas 2019)| 50% Starting NP gauge, Increases NP generation rate by 10%. Starts battle with 50% NP gauge. 
 | Card buff to the card you'll be spamming the most, let's you get off NP turn 1 without any help and increases NP Gen to further increase ability to spam. If you're unsure this is your best option.
Hide Hunter (Summer Camp 2020)|Star bomb | Gives you a star bomb right away to let you crit turn 1, increases your crit damage and NP gen, all things that help Gogh in spamming that NP.
Any 50% starting | At least 50% Starting NP Gauge| For when you want to get off your NP turn 1 and don't have anything better.
Immaginary Around (General Pool) | |Super charge those quicks since you'll be pressing it a lot. If starting charge isn't a problem and you plan on having Gogh as the main dps, this will help increase her facecard damage and np gen aka the main source of your damage.
Honey Lake (Summer 5 Gacha) | |If you're willing to devote your burn command codes to Gogh or glue yourself to Yang, this CE is amazing. Unique Mod is multiplicative and will do a lot more to your damage than Crit (diluted by Gogh's NP) and Card Ups. If you don't need the starting NP, and can run the command codes, would absolutely recommend it
Self Portrait at Chaldea (Bond CE) |When equipped on Van Gogh, Grants self "Gain 8 Critical Stars/turn" Status, and increases the party's Critical Damage by 15%, for as long as she is on the field|Functionally a 2030 with a bonus party crit buff. It's neat. Gogh's bond is only 6, please ask again next year...

## Command Code

Name (How to Acquire) | Effect | Comments
----------------------|--------|---------
Legend Beast of the Grove (New Years 2019)| Inflicts Curse with 500 damage for 3 turns to enemy when attacking using the engraved card.  |The only source of Command Code curse. Use it. Who else needs it anyways? 
Code : Cure (FP Gacha) | Removes one Ailment Debuff when attacking using the engraved card. | This will also remove your curses but Boss DOTs can chip away your damage even when they're in terror so best to get rid of them. 
Maiden of Orleans (Christmas 2019) | Can only use once every 3 turns, recovers 1000 HP when attacking using the engraved card.  | HP Recovery Option if you're composition is lacking
Heavenly Emperor's Consort (Imaginary Scramble) | Increases critical damage against enemies with Burn debuff by 30% of the engraved card. | Doesn't apply burn but ensures if you do have burn already applied that big numbers will happen.
Gentleman with Brilliant Goatee's Command Seal (Saber Wars II) | Inflicts Burn with 500 damage for 3 turns to enemy when attacking using the engraved card. | Burn Code for Honey Lake
Djinn's Lamp (Valentine's 2020) | Inflicts Burn with 300 damage for 3 turns to the enemy when attacking using the engraved card.
Gains 2 critical stars when attacking using the engraved card. | Burn Code that also grants stars
True Crimson Immortal Maiden's Command Seal (Summer Camp 2020) | Inflicts Burn with 300 damage for 3 turns to the enemy when attacking using the engraved card. Increase critical damage by 5% of the engraved card. | Burn code that gives a small crit bonus
Meteoric Bellows (Grail Live) | Inflicts Burn with 500 damage for 3 turns to the enemy when attacking using the engraved card. Increases critical star absorption by 50% of the engraved card. | Burn Code
Magus of FLowers (Las Vegas Official Bout) | Can only use once every 3 turns, charges own NP gauge by 10% when attacking with engraved card. | Put it on Gogh's buster card to ensure you'll be getting gauge no matter what button is pressed.

#### How many burn codes should I run?
There's multiple things to consider here. Do you have your own Yang? How much will you prioritize Gogh's face cards over the rest of the team (like say S.BB). I've generally found on Gogh focused team with no Yang that three does just fine.



## Party Members


### Solo

I don't have many experiences doing solos but I've heard they're quite fun and doable. 
### Existence Outside the Domain

Pros:
 If you don't get good face card luck on Gogh, even S!Abigail can deal big damage numbers thanks to Gogh's NP buff ensuring your damage is consistently high every turn.

It's nice to not run the same double support teams all the time.


Cons:
Some servants will be competing with Gogh for face card priority and critical stars being divided may make it difficult to land crits (where the majority of your damage is).

All these servants are almost all luxuries. Most of them will do fine on their own already. Gogh's honestly pretty self sufficient so none of these are must rolls, you're better off going with the supports.


Name | Comments
-----|--------
Van Gogh | Double the Gogh joke! Double the fun! If you want to spam NPs forever and watch your opponent stand in terror. Be careful on how you bounce around the curse stacks between the two but this is an easy composition to work with.
Abigail | The NP drain will help buy you another turn if your terror RNG isn't good while also having terror on a button herself. She functionally has a 60% charge that takes a few turns to build up in exchange for also giving the party members (aka Gogh) charge. The buff removal on NP is also useful. 
Summer Abigail |  A good support to Gogh providing buff removal, a terror on her 2 to help fill the gap in between NPs and a 50% NP charge on her 3 ensuring that S Abigail will still be able to fire off her NP without using her cards often. 
Hokusai (Foreigner) |  No good. Hokusai's 3 wants you to be pressing her arts cards so you can't have it up at the same time as Gogh's 3. You'll divide yourself too thin, unable to get either person's NPs off and Hokusai doesn't nearly have enough steroids by herself to be main dps or even alternate DPS.
Yang Guifei | You'll have problems with stars (so bring a 2030) and a 50% support (likely locked into Castoria I had trouble keeping uptime on Gogh's np while clearing some waves while testing).
Summer BB | With her card lock and amazing self steroid Summer BB will now be the star of the show and with her Card Lock you can deal high and consistent damage for 3 turns and not worry about being screwed by RNG.
Voyager | Trades the utility of the Abigails for more compatible cards and another crit buff and star absorb. The debuff immunity on his 1 has its useful but make sure to press it only after Gogh has applied her stacks on her 2.
MHIXA | The one welfare option. The dodge will cancel each other out but she provides her own card steroid on her 1 and a charisma with a heal attached on her 3. Her 2's 100% Crit is only for 1 turn is less impressive thanks to Gogh's NP but still welcome. 


### Support Casters

Name | Comments
-----|--------
Merlin |If you want healing and don't have to worry about mitigating big damage often. My preferred CE is Prisma Cosmos since I won't be pressing his cards often.
Skadi | When you want to go fast and don't need to worry about incoming damage.
Artoria (Caster) | Her NP will remove curse stacks so be careful. When there's multiple servants you have to worry about or you can't reliably get off terror to mitigate hits.
Waver | The generalist support. He may not be as good as other options but he's in the general pool and also everyone and their mother who didn't have him picked him for the free SSR ticket. 
Hans | Budget Option but if you're running double dps (such as double Gogh), his crit buff applies to both while granting free stars and flat NP gen per a turn.  Not to mention he charges his gauge himself with a skill.


### Other Options

Name | Comments
-----|--------
Ashiya Douman | Guess whose Chaotic Evil! NNNNN! His 1 gives you another chance at terror, his 2 is an aoe curse that can be absorbed by Gogh as well and grants another 100% crit buff to Gogh. His 3 is another stack of curses to the enemy and applies another 40% attack buff to Gogh. Just be careful about all the curses bouncing around as it can become quite spicy if you absorb too much and can't cleanse in time. But this humble priest is a perfect supporter to Gogh and deals impressive damage himself even without having the Existence Outside the Domain Trait. His buffs are tied to skills though so you will have to settle to having some amount of downtime.


## Mystic Codes

Name | Comments
-----|--------
Atlas Academy| My go to largely for the CD reduction but the cleanse and invuln help a lot too.
Plug Suit | Most useful if the boss has NPs that remove buffs to protect Gogh.

## Things to Watch Out For

Frequent Debuff Cleanse or flat out debuff immunities are your worst enemy.

## Challenge Quests


Imaginary Scramble

Van Gogh+Merlin+Castoria

Gogh's the bonus servant so big damage numbers all around. 

Christmas
Van Gogh+S Abigail+Skadi

It's better to just go fast on this one and never have to see a single Dioscuri NP because of the Pierce.

Saber Wars 2: 

Van Gogh+Castoria+S Abigail

Make sure you have S Abigail ready for the NP formation. This CQ is just an annoyance all around between trying to juggle the three different NP arrows and having to get the right rng for formations.

Little Big Tengu:

Van Gogh+Merlin+ S Abigail

Take your time prepping on Ushiwaka so that you can burst down Taira as fast as possible. Taira removes buffs on NP so you'll literally never want to see it.

Valentine's 2021:

Van Gogh+ +S Abigail+Skadi

Easy. The boars being berserker means even the few hits they get in won't deal much damage and you can chew right through the waves. I gave my Special Choco to Van Gogh so I could crit through the anti-female defense buff just fine.

White Day:

Van Gogh+Merlin+Castoria

The taunts and constant switching means you'll be taking a decent amount of damage as the terror won't help as much. It's likely more efficient to go for an AOE dps instead of Gogh comp but this guide isn't about that.

Akiba Tower

Van Gogh+Limbo+Merlin:

Blackbeard is the hardest part since he can get off an unlucky crit on Merlin. From there it's pretty smooth sailing. 



Imaginary Grail Live

Van Gogh+

I remember getting super annoyed at Lanling cleansing the debuffs every turn. This is definitely a hard CQ to do on Gogh and I'd focus on Lanling ASAP.

Summer 5

Van Gogh+S Abigail+Merlin
Hide Hunter (MLB) Hide Hunter (MLB) Prisma Cosmos (MLB)

Not bad at all. You'll generally clear the adds in a card or two if you have the buffs up and enemies swapping out with Terror will come back in with Terror.



## Lostbelt 6 (PT1) Camelot Battle Log

Standard characters used:

Gogh (Honey Lake)

Abigail (2030)

Hans (2030)

Merlin (MLB Prisma Cosmos)



Chapter 3

Anubis Head (Second to last Arrow)
Composition:

Abigail (2030) Gogh (Honey Lake) Castoria

Honey Lake takes care of the evade

Fairy Knight Gawain:
Her attacking trait changes it to berserker so she doesn't hit hard on Gogh or Abigail
Abigail (2030) Gogh (Honey Lake) Castoria
Starts with a Taunt every turn, use Castoria's 3 on her if she's marked and terror didn't proc the stun.
.Finished Turn 7 - Auto End

Chapter 5
Arrow 1
 Red Hare (Lol)
Abigail (2030) Gogh (Honey Lake) Castoria->Merlin
Summons Adds on First break and buffs them all

Arrow 2
Abigail(2030) Gogh(Honey Lake) Limbo NP2 (Traces of Christmas)
Note: you're reduced to level 1 for these fights.
You have a chance of skill seal every turn.
NPd the first wave with limbo
Slowly face carded the 2nd.

Chapter 6 
Arrow 2
Assassin Waves+Solo Berserker

Van Gogh(Honey Lake)+Hans (2030)+Van Gogh (Hide Hunter/NP2)

Free Curses for both Goghs! Skyrocket your NP and cast them every turn with one easy step.
I brought Hans with the intention of letting him die to curses but the fight was fast enough.

Arrow 4

Red Hare Muramasa (Alter Ego) Da Vinci (Rider)

Van Gogh (Honey Lake)+Brynhilldr (Golden Sumo)+Castoria

Muramasa has defensive buffs up, making him tankier. Would honestly just take down Red Hare+Da Vinci first and then let backline dps handle Muramasa rather than strictly relying on Gogh but I can safely say that Gogh can still crit Muramasa down. There will be a bit of RNG involved though in terms of skill activations, terror, etc.


Chapter 8

Arrow 2

Story forced Castoria+Gareth+Gogh(Honey Lake)+Abigail (2030)

Popped all skills and put Castoria's arts up on Gareth to tank the the Wave 1 Berserkers

Face carded through Wave 2

Broke Cat's bar turn 1 and ate the NP drain woops  From there you have to stall forever with cat draining your np every turn. Lost Gareth and brought in Abigail and then thanks to terror procs NP drained Cat with Abby 3 to avoid the autofilled NP and broke the bars once the defense buffs were done.


Arrow 3

Forced Castoria+Muramasa+Van Gogh+Abigail+Merlin(Prisma)
I let Castoria and Muramasa eat the Tamamo cat NP so i could bring out Abigail and Merlin.


Chapter 9

Forced Support
Castoria+Gogh(Honey Lake)+Merlin(Prisma)

Wave 1: Gorgon

Free curses every turn means you can safely press Castoria's NP whenever you want without losing any curse stacks. I didn't even see the changing mechanic. I just crit from 50% to 0 in one Gogh.

Wave 2: Eye saber thing
AOE Autos
Drains NP gauge and stars on enter. also some max hp down buff
You'll do just fine terror locking the enemy.

Final Arrow

Van Gogh+Abigail+Limbo (NP2)

Limbo Clear Wave 1 press 1+3 on limbo, 2-3-1 on Gogh

Gogh crits the Boar on Wave 2 in one Buster card

Tamamo Cat (yet again I know)
She applies some debuff at the start, has an unlimited guts lmao
She max charges her np every time you break guts
Made it to turn 9 after eating a few of the NPs… IDEK. Nobody on my frontline ever died (yay for guts+foreigners) and then she auto died.

Chapter 9
Node 1

Gogh+Gogh (His rightful place)+ Hans
Just alternate who has the Quick Buff up


Node 4

Lol forced team

Node 5

Forced support, took Castoria
Abigail+Gogh

More free curse stacks every time the mobs attack.

Node 6

Gogh+Merlin+S BB

Set up w/ Gogh then Cardlocked with BB to clear waves. Probably should've taken a 50% charge CE instead of lake and 2030 instead of Prisma to set up faster.

Node 7

Forced to take 3 story and no friend support
AOE Autos
Has some skill that just drops a ton of curses at once on a party member
Every time you attack party member gets a curse
